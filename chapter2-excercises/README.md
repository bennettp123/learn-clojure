Shell session recorded in [excercises.script](excercises.script).

Recorded with script(1).

Play back with `cat excercises.script`. This might need to be performed in the
same kind of terminal as the recording (xterm-256color).

TODO: record with `script -r, so it can be played back with script -p`?
